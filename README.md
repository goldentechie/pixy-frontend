# Pixy Frontend Developer Interview: Take-Home Exercise
@goldentechie

## Requirements
### ✅1. Create a SPA using React that displays a 3x3 grid of fake NFT cards with arbitrary images.
### ✅2. The app should have a fake “Connect Wallet” button at the top.
### ✅3. When “Connect Wallet” is clicked:
> #### ✅a. The “Connect Wallet” button should switch to “Connected”
> #### ✅b. Text that says “My NFTs: 0” displays next to “Connected”
> #### ✅c. A “Buy NFT” button displays on each NFT card
### ✅4. When each “Buy NFT” button is clicked, the NFT card disappears, and the “My NFTs: 0” counter is incremented.
### ✅5. When the page is resized to <= 480px, the grid should resize so each NFT is full-width and takes up one row.
### ✅6. When the page is refreshed, everything resets back to its initial state.
### ✅7. Document environment setup in the README.md.

## Description
#

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) and [React Bootstrap](https://react-bootstrap.github.io/).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm install`
Install dependenies.

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
